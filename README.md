Notes and examples for getting started with [libcinder](https://libcinder.org/).

### API Reference

I document the things I use for the operating system(s) I use them on; i.e. Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.

**Motivation**

- The official documentation lacks examples.
- Contributing to the existing documentation is difficult.
- Existing documentation lacks timestamp.

Furthermore, it is advised that the [samples] are the best way to learn Cinder, but samples do not communicate intent or reason.
