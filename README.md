### Personal API Reference

My personal notes and reference for Cinder.

- https://mottosso.gitbooks.io/cinder/content/

**Motivation**

- The official documentation lacks examples.
- Contributing to the existing documentation is difficult.
- Existing documentation lacks sense of time (is it new? is it old?).

[Samples] are the suggested best way to learn Cinder, but I need more.
