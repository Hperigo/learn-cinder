# Learn Cinder

Notes and examples for getting started with [libcinder](https://libcinder.org/).

<br>
<br>

### Usage

1. Open [`sublime.sublime-project`](https://github.com/mottosso/learn-cinder/blob/master/sublime.sublime-project)
2. Navigate to `/src` of a project
3. Build with F7

The project configuration contains a build system which triggers `cibuild`.

### API Reference

I document the things I use for the operating system(s) I use them on; i.e. Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.

**Motivation**

- The official documentation lacks examples.
- Contributing to the existing documentation is difficult.
- Existing documentation lacks sense of time (is it new? is it old?).

[Samples] are the suggested best way to learn Cinder, but I need more.
